======

Education
======
* B.Eng. in Computer Science, Lanzhou University, 2016
* Ph.D. student in Institute of Hign Energy Physics / University of Chineses Academy of Science

Research Interests
======
* High Performance (TB/s) Computing Architecture
* Memory Disaggregation
* Fault Diagnosis
* AI for Science, Computing for Science.
* Web Technology

Research Highlights
======
* Fault monitoring and diagnosis in large-scale distributed clusters: H. Zhang, M. Gu and S. Fan, "Fault Detection and Diagnosis Software of LHAASO," in IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science, doi: 10.1109/TNS.2024.3454806.
* Open-source large-scale collaboration member management system, with over 3000 users: [Link](https://github.com/rabchang/member-oa)
* High-performance, efficient, and reliable distributed memory cache pool: in progress.


Professional experience
======
* 2021.5-2021.8 LHAASO Electronic Control System Development

Mainly responsible for JAVA Spring Cloud development, responsible for writing RESTful services to be provided to the front end.

* 2022.09-2023.04 Member Management System

Developed the member management system for the science experiment collaborations. The system uses NextJS for the front-end and SpringBoot for the back-end, and I am responsible for writing all the code for both the front-end and the back-end. Currently used in three large-scale international collaborations, with more than 3,000 users.

* 2022.12-2023.12 Fault Monitoring and Diagnosis System

Developed a fault detection and diagnosis system for large-scale scientific experiments. The system uses Python and provides users with a common monitoring tool, unified fault monitoring and DAG-based root cause analysis of faults. I am responsible for all aspects of the system. It has been used in LHAASO and achieved good results.

* 2023.10-NOW Distributed Memory Buffer Pool

Dedicated to improving the reliability and stability of large-scale online distributed data systems. Modified based on MinIO so that it can run on memory and manage distributed memory. Currently, it can manage a cluster of 50 computers with over 25TB of memory, achieving more than 10GB/s of mixed reads and writes, and running stably.

* 2024.01-NOW  Application of Large Language Models to Online Systems for High Energy Physics

Deploying and fine-tuning ChatGLM3-6B to explore the use of large langugage models to improve the user experience of high-energy physics online systems.

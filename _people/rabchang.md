I am a master and PhD candidate from the [Institute of High Energy Physics](http://ihep.cas.cn), Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research focuses on high-performance data acquisition(DAQ) and cloud computing architectures. I primarily work with Java and Python, and am also proficient in JavaScript and C++. I am the member of [LHAASO](http://english.ihep.cas.cn/lhaaso/index.html), [JUNO](http://juno.ihep.cas.cn/), and [BESIII](http://bes3.ihep.ac.cn/) experiments. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from [Lanzhou University](https://xxxy.ihep.ac.cn).
